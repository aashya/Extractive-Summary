Running the code

Generate_Summary
	1. Add Path for files
	2. Add file format (current format is .story)
	3. Alter max iteration as per required. Current is 10000 which will be able to summarise about 6 paragraphs.


Extractive Summarization: It is the technique to summarise articles by selecting a subset of words that retain the most important points. Unlike abstractive summarisation it does not look at the semantic understanding of words

Approach
1. Import necessary libraries
2. Read_Article
	Clean sentences are generated by opening the file and splitting first by paragraph and then by sentence, finally giving a list of all sentences in the file.
3. Similarity Matrix
	A cosine similarity matrix tells us word vector in the vocabularity that is most similar to word vector given as an argument. This is done by measuring the cosine of angle between the vectors. If sentences are similar, angle will be 0
4. Input file 
	The file is inputted in a loop wherein all the files within that folder will be seen one by one and summary will be given. 
5. Rank sentences using Google Pagerank and then sort them as per rank. The top ranked sentences give the summary
